# Olympics-movies-data-analysis


As part of [FrauenLoop](http://frauenloop.org/) SQL cycle we have been challenged to put into practice our database management skills by choosing 2 Kaggle datasets and presenting insights through graphs. The analysis below is based on the [IMDB 5000 Movie Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/deepmatrix/imdb-5000-movie-dataset)
and the[Olympics Sports and Medals from 1896 to 2014](https://www.kaggle.com/the-guardian/olympic-games"). I have used Python programming language, Pygal for data visualization and SQLite as a database engine.
