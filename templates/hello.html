	<h1 class="text-center">FrauenLoop, SQL cycle - Final Project</h1>
	<p> As part of FrauenLoop SQL Cycle we have been challenged to put into practice our database management skills by choosing 2 Kaggle datasets and present insights through graphs. The analysis below is based on the  <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/deepmatrix/imdb-5000-movie-dataset" target="_blank"> IMDB 5000 Movie Dataset </a>
and the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/the-guardian/olympic-games" target="_blank">Olympics Sports and Medals from 1896 to 2014 </a> . I have used Python programming language, Pygal for data visualization and SQLite as a database engine.

	<h2 class="text-center">Movies Dataset</h2>
	<p>This dataset lists information about the top 5000 movies scraped from IMDB website.

		<h3>Movies and profit</h3>

			   <a class="lien" role="button" data-toggle="collapse" href="#collapse1" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseExample">See SQL Query</a>
				<div class="collapse" id="collapse1">
  					<div class="well">Select movie_title, gross, budget,(gross-budget) as profit <br> from movies <br>where gross!='' and budget!='' <br>order by profit desc <br>limit 10;
  					</div>
  				</div>
		<p>From this graph we can see for the top 10 most profitable movies that some managed to get to this position thanks to an important investment compared to other movies. Indeed, movies such as Star Wars or EI had a low budget spend to generate a return on investment of about 40%. Which was not the case for movies such as Avatar or The Avengers that respectively have a ROI of about 2,21% and 1,83% and Revenue between 600 and 700 millions.</p>

  					</div>
  				</div>
		<p>Keeping the revenue as subject, I am comparing it now to the genres. This Pie shows the revenue split by genres. What genres generate the highest revenues? The answer is Action movies representing 37% of this top 10! They are followed by Comedies representing 21% of this top 10 revenue.

		<p>With this graph I am showing the TOP 10 actors who played in the most expensive movies to produce. Robert De Niro comes first having played in movies such as Tootsie or Cars.

		<h3>Movies and colors</h3>

  					</div>
  				</div>
		<p>For this graph I wanted to know if the color of a movie was impacting its IMDB score. I was personally assuming that the movies in color would be better scored.  I have selected the 20 last years for this analysis and according to the movies from this dataset black and white ones are generally better scored. It’s in 2008 that the average scores from both type of movie where actually comparable scored at 6.34.  During this period of time 205 movies from this dataset were black and white and 4693 were color. We can assume that the rarity of the black and white movies actually attracts and certain type of audience, an audience that would more generous in terms of rating. </p>

		<h3>Duration and Facebook likes</h3>

				<div class="collapse" id="collapse5">
  					<div class="well">Select duration, movie_facebook_likes <br>from movies <br>where duration !="";
  					</div>
  				</div>
		<p>
In this graph a positive linear correlation between the Facebook likes and the film duration is not affirmed. However we can easily notice a concentration of movies lasting between 100 and 150 minutes and having between 0 and 40k likes.  We can also see that long lasting movies don’t get very high number of likes on Facebook.

  					</div>
  				</div>
		<p>The last graph for this movie dataset shows the average Imdb score by genre. My question was: What is the genres that is the best scored?  History movies are better scored than Music movies with respectively 7.5 and 7.2 in average; against 2.9 for Game-Show. The genres generating highest revenues are not the best scored. Indeed, Action movie as a genre doesn’t even appear in this top 10.</p>

  					</div>
  				</div>
		<p>This first graph shows the gap of medals won per gender. I have selected the countries by taking the top 30 with the highest medals won per women. When the number of medals won by men is always higher than the ones won by women, only Romania as a comparable number of medals won per gender. </p>

  				</div>
		<p>With this second graph I wanted to see if the difference was changing during summer games or winter games.  This graph shows the victory split by gender and by type of game (summer or winter).  Despite the fact that men receive and have the opportunity to win more medals than women we can see that the gap is less important during winter games. </p>

  					</div>
  				</div>
		<p>I was talking about opportunities earlier, in fact women have less games open to them compared to men. If you have a look at this third graph we can clearly see that in 1896 during the first Olympics games no women were even allowed to compete, we had to wait for the year 1900 to see the first women participating, this was in Paris. It’s only games after games than sport categories were opening to women.</p>

		<p>Let’s put this gender equity problem aside and have a look at this histogram. I am showing through it the best athletes per sport.  The winner is Michael Phelps in Aquatics with 22 medals followed by Larissa Latynina in Gymnastics. I let you discover the Top 10 …</p>

  				</div>
		<p>In the same logic and in a bigger scale, the question I was wondering is: In which sport each country is better at? Which sport had the highest medal count by country? I invite you to over on the countries you interested it or play with the legend to highlight them on the map.  What I can tell you is that Chile is doing well in Tennis and Nigeria in Athletics!</p>

		<p>My last question is: Is the fact to host a game impacts the performance of athletes? It’s known that playing a game at home is often an advantage. I can confirm it with this bar chart; I calculated a average growth of 102% when countries were hosting the games. 
Comparing the USA and China having a comparable total of medals china’s number of medals growth is higher is more important, respectively at +209% and +64%.

		<p>This combined graph shows information from both datasets. I am comparing here the medals and movies in the 90’s and 00’s. There are more movies overtime and much more medals, which is expected. With this graphs that I found interesting is that we have an idea of the distribution.  Comparing the quartiles of the movies list, Q1 was at 17.25 movies by country in 90’s against 24.5 in 2000’s. The growth can also be seen comparing the maximum value from both decades that increased by 48% for the movies and 310.5% for the medals.</p>

<h3>To conclude ...</h3>
<p>
While analyzing the movie dataset, some aspects of movies have been highlighted. We have seen the impact of the color, duration, genres on the revenue or on the Imdb Score. 
<br>The Olympics games dataset analysis highlighted a gender equity issue along with the strength of each country regarding the sports  and how certain countries are more performing than others when they are hosting the games. 

<br>Thanks for reading,

</p>

<br>
<p style="font-size:11px;">Note: More than 35000 medals have been won since the beginning of the games. The Olympics Games dataset has a row per athlete, when a team wins a medal this dataset will count 4 medals (rows) for the 4x100 meter relay gold medal winner.<br>To have figures closed to what we find online I created a unique medals table grouping my initial table by medal, category_id, event, country_code and gender. </p>
